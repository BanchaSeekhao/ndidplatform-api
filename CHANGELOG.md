# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (June 30, 2018)

BREAKING CHANGES:
- API version 1.1

- Configurable callback retry timeout. The config only applies to some callbacks. Can be set with `CALLBACK_RETRY_TIMEOUT` environment variable. Accept number in seconds. ([#25](https://github.com/ndidplatform/api/issues/25))
- Handle error when IdP sending a response to a closed or timed out request. Send back a correct error code/message. ([#29](https://github.com/ndidplatform/api/issues/29))
